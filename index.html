        <h2>Chapter 1: The Big Announcement</h2>
        <p>When declamation was first announced, I was wondering what kind of declamation it would be. What kind of topic would we have? Would it be a fun one? But then the topic was announced: "Problems of the World" (I think). Then we had to draw papers to see which topic we’d be assigned. I got discrimination, which was a bizarre coincidence because me and my friends always joke around saying, "My lawyer advised me not to say this" all the time. It felt like a sign, and it was kind of funny!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2: The Practice Week</h2>
        <p>The practice week was practically a free week because we just had to practice. But practice was still hard! I had to kneel down so much during my practice sessions that I honestly thought my legs were sprained or even broken. Anyway, it wasn’t all bad, though—it was still easy in a way. Oh, and memorizing my speech? A breeze! I memorized it quickly, and I felt pretty confident about that part.</p>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 3: Declamation Day</h2>
        <p>Declamation day arrived, and I was, not gonna lie, a little nervous. But the thing was, I had fully memorized my speech a while ago, so it was practically easy to perform. I did forget a few lines when I got to the stage, but I improvised, and it all worked out in the end. And that’s it—project done! Bye bye!</p>
